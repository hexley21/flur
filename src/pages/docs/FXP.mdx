# Flur Experience Points (FXP) Documentation

Welcome to the **Flur Experience Points (FXP)** documentation page! This page will guide you through everything you need to know about FXP, an innovative token that uses **Trade to Mint** technology to distribute rewards through completed trades on Flur or via the Flur smart contract.

## What is FXP?

**Flur Experience Points (FXP)** is a unique token designed to incentivize trading activity. FXP stands out from traditional tokens by using a **Trade to Mint** mechanism. This means that tokens are only minted (released) as a reward when a trade is fully completed. The process is simple: you must engage in a full trade (either a buy or sell order) to unlock a mint.

## Key Features of FXP

### 1. Trade to Mint Technology

The core feature of FXP is its **Trade to Mint** design:

- **Only way to mint FXP**: A mint is unlocked only after a full trade is completed on Flur or via the Flur smart contract.
- **Open order book trades**: The trade must be a fully executed order (no partial orders).
- **Claimable Mint**: Once a trade is complete, a mint is available for both the buyer and seller to claim. It doesn’t matter which party initiates the claim; both participants will receive the reward once the transaction is mined on-chain.

### 2. Mint Reward Distribution

- **Both buyer and seller rewarded**: Upon the completion of a trade, both the buyer and the seller are rewarded equally. For instance, if the mint reward is **10 FXP**, both the buyer and seller will receive **10 FXP each**.
  
### 3. Randomized Minting System

The number of tokens released per mint is randomly determined by the blockchain’s output hash, and can vary widely:

- **Random Mint Reward**: Each mint releases a random number of FXP, anywhere from **1 to 129 tokens**.
- **Special Reward**: There is a special mint of **420 tokens** if the output hash hits **number 69** during the minting process.

### 4. Full Orders Only

- **No rewards for partial fills**: Only full buy or sell orders trigger a mint. If an order is partially filled, no mint will be unlocked until the entire order is completed.

## How to Mint FXP

### 1. Complete a Full Trade

To unlock a mint, you must complete a **full buy or sell order** on Flur’s open order book. Remember, only **fully executed orders** unlock mints, and partial orders do not qualify.

### 2. Claim Your Mint

Once a mint is unlocked, your wallet will have a **claimable mint** or a **mint claim available**. Either the buyer or seller can initiate the mint claim. Once the transaction is on-chain and confirmed, both the buyer and seller receive their FXP reward.

### 3. Receive Tokens

The number of FXP tokens you receive will be randomly determined by the blockchain output hash and will range from **1 to 129 tokens**. There’s also a chance of receiving a special mint of **420 tokens** if your mint hits output hash **69**.

## Example Scenarios

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### 1. What is Trade to Mint?

Trade to Mint is a new minting mechanism where tokens are only minted as a reward when a full trade is completed. This means that no FXP is pre-mined or released in any way other than through trading activity.

You unlock a mint by completing a full buy or sell order on Flur or through the Flur smart contract. Once the trade is completed, both the buyer and seller can claim their FXP rewards.

Partial orders do not unlock mints. You must complete the entire order (whether buying or selling) for a mint to be unlocked.

### 4. How many tokens can I receive per mint?

The number of tokens is randomly generated and can be anywhere from **1 to 129 FXP**. There is also a special reward of **420 FXP** if the mint output hash hits **69**.

### 5. How is the total supply determined?

The total supply is unknown and will be determined by the number of mints and the random mint rewards. It is estimated that around **2+ billion tokens** will be minted based on the total number of mints (21 million) and the average tokens per mint.
